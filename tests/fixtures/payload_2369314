If writing code is helpful, please include code as well.\n    Question Title: Why does sed require 3 backslashes for a regular backslash?\n    Question Body: I'm curious, why does sed need 3 `\\` just to recognize one? I'd understand it needing 2, but 3 I don't.\n\nEDIT: here's an example on my Windows computer, using Cygwin:\n\n```\n$ echo \"sample_input\\whatever\" | sed \"s/\\\\\\/\\//\"\nsample_input/whatever\n```\n\n\nIf I don't add 3 backslashes, I get a \n\n```\nsed: -e expression #1, char 7: unterminated s' command\n```\n\n", "task": "generic2"}
